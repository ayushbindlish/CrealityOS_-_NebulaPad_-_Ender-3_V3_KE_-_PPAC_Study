On the Discord server https://discord.gg/d3vil-design

I found the pinout of the USB-C port (where to connect the g-sensor) on a NebulaPad
(but I still have to understand how to interpret the "1/2" entries in the "USB-C" column...)

> USB-C port on the underside is actually a SPI interface with the following pinout

> With just a cable plugged in there were also voltages across the A/B 2,3,10 & 11 ranging from 0.001 V and 3,4 V so some of those are definitely connected to something, although I couldn't immediately find what. So be careful with plugging in other stuff.

and a photo showing the pinout of a g-sensor
(but I don't know if this is standard or varies between g-sensors, so check before use)
